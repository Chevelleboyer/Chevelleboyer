# Hi, I'm Chevelle

I love to code and I *love* a good e36

## What I'm About

I believe in simple solutions. I strongly believe that software engineers *are not special*. Anyone who has a desire to learn can do what we do, it's not hard. 

What is hard is having a good attitude and being a good person. Those qualities are **so** much more important than being technically exceptional. Because like I said, anyone can learn this shit.


## What I like

I like refactoring. I look at an old run down code base the same way I look at an old beat up 94' e36.. In awe. I see the potential, and how much fun it will be to restore. Greenfield projects are so mainstreamðŸ™„   

Jokes aside, I really enjoy learning from people like Sandi Metz, and Martin Fowler. They have taught me about what refactoring really means. **Spoiler alert:** It's not about making code prettier. And get this, there are right and wrong ways of doing it.

I like tests. Once upon a time I was warned about how many companies don't test.. yet I still cringe each time I see it. *If you don't test you are doing it wrong.*  

Software practices aside, I love old BMWs. There is something so romantic about being shoulder deep in an oily e36 engine bay struggling to seat your timing chain..   

## Where you'll find me on the weekends  

You'll find me spoiling my dogs.   

You'll find me at the rock gym. (I'm not very good).  

You'll find me drinking coffee way too late, working on my cars.
